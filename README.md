# Commitee-Project
A naive financial method of saving and generally known as the term "Commitee" and "Society" that is basically a financial intermediary group usually consists of 10 - 20 members
They are basically self-governed and Peer Controlled. One of the Member is managing all the activities and keep monthly statements of every member including herself/himself.

Have that idea in my mind i try to drag this native procedure to a web application that allows the head members to manage all those activities
